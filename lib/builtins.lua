--- @alias float number
--- A floating-point number. This is a single-precision floating point number. Whilst Lua only uses double-precision
--- numbers, when a function takes a float, the game engine will immediately convert the double-precision number to
--- single-precision.

--- @alias double number
--- A double-precision floating-point number. This is the same data type as all Lua numbers use.

--- @alias int number
--- 32-bit signed integer. Possible values are -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

--- @alias int8 number
--- 8-bit signed integer. Possible values are -128 to 127.

--- @alias uint number
--- 32-bit unsigned integer. Possible values are 0 to 4,294,967,295.

--- @alias uint8 number
--- 8-bit unsigned integer. Possible values are 0 to 255.

--- @alias uint16 number
--- 16-bit unsigned integer. Possible values are 0 to 65535.

--- @alias uint64 number
--- 64-bit unsigned integer. Possible values are 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.

--- @alias int16 number
--- 16-bit signed integer. Possible values are -32,768 to 32,767.

--- @alias int32 number
--- 32-bit signed integer. Possible values are -2147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

--- @alias int64 number
--- 32-bit signed integer. Possible values are -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

--- @alias uint32 number
--- 32-bit signed integer. Possible values are 0 to 4,294,967,295.

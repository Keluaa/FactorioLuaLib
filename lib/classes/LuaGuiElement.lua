--- @class LuaGuiElement
--- An element of a custom GUI. This type is used to represent any kind of a GUI element - labels, buttons and frames
--- are all instances of this type. Just like LuaEntity, different kinds of elements support different attributes;
--- attempting to access an attribute on an element that doesn't support it (for instance, trying to access the
--- `column_count` of a `textfield`) will result in a runtime error.
--- The following types of GUI element are supported:
--- - `"button"`: A clickable element. Relevant event: on_gui_click
--- - `"sprite-button"`: A `button` that displays a sprite rather than text. Relevant event: on_gui_click
--- - `"checkbox"`: A clickable element with a check mark that can be turned off or on. Relevant event:
--- on_gui_checked_state_changed
--- - `"flow"`: An invisible container that lays out its children either horizontally or vertically.
--- - `"frame"`: A non-transparent box that contains other elements. It can have a title (set via the `caption`
--- attribute). Just like a `flow`, it lays out its children either horizontally or vertically. Relevant event:
--- on_gui_location_changed
--- - `"label"`: A piece of text.
--- - `"line"`: A horizontal or vertical separation line.
--- - `"progressbar"`: A partially filled bar that can be used to indicate progress.
--- - `"table"`: An invisible container that lays out its children in a specific number of columns. The width of each
--- column is determined by the widest element it contains.
--- - `"textfield"`: A single-line box the user can type into. Relevant events: on_gui_text_changed, on_gui_confirmed
--- - `"radiobutton"`: A clickable element that is functionally identical to a `checkbox`, but has a circular
--- appearance. Relevant event: on_gui_checked_state_changed
--- - `"sprite"`: An element that shows an image.
--- - `"scroll-pane"`: An invisible element that is similar to a `flow`, but has the ability to show and use scroll
--- bars.
--- - `"drop-down"`: A drop-down containing strings of text. Relevant event: on_gui_selection_state_changed
--- - `"list-box"`: A list of strings, only one of which can be selected at a time. Shows a scroll bar if necessary.
--- Relevant event: on_gui_selection_state_changed
--- - `"camera"`: A camera that shows the game at the given position on the given surface. It can visually track an
--- entity that is set after the element has been created.
--- - `"choose-elem-button"`: A button that lets the player pick from a certain kind of prototype, with optional
--- filtering. Relevant event: on_gui_elem_changed
--- - `"text-box"`: A multi-line `textfield`. Relevant event: on_gui_text_changed
--- - `"slider"`: A horizontal number line which can be used to choose a number. Relevant event: on_gui_value_changed
--- - `"minimap"`: A minimap preview, similar to the normal player minimap. It can visually track an entity that is set
--- after the element has been created.
--- - `"entity-preview"`: A preview of an entity. The entity has to be set after the element has been created.
--- - `"empty-widget"`: An empty element that just exists. The root GUI elements `screen` and `relative` are `empty-
--- widget`s.
--- - `"tabbed-pane"`: A collection of `tab`s and their contents. Relevant event: on_gui_selected_tab_changed
--- - `"tab"`: A tab for use in a `tabbed-pane`.
--- - `"switch"`: A switch with three possible states. Can have labels attached to either side. Relevant event:
--- on_gui_switch_state_changed
--- Each GUI element allows access to its children by having them as attributes. Thus, one can use the `parent.child`
--- syntax to refer to children. Lua also supports the `parent["child"]` syntax to refer to the same element. This can
--- be used in cases where the child has a name that isn't a valid Lua identifier.
